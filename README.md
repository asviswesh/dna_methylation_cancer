Tools to help healthcare professionals identify a cancer type based on DNA Methylation profiles are currently unavailable. DNA methylation pattern changes occur early, so it can be used in the early detection of cancer. Machine learning algorithms were developed in this study to predict a particular kind of cancer. DNA methylation profiles of Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Sarcoma, Skin Cutaneous Melanoma, Stomach Adenocarcinoma, Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma, and Brain Lower Grade Glioma were downloaded from “The Cancer Genome Atlas”. 1200 samples with 200 records per cancer type and 485,577 features per record were extracted, cleaned, balanced, and feature engineered. Five different computational models were built using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest. Precision, Recall, and f1_score were used to evaluate and compare their performance. Logistic Regression and Linear Support Vector Machines gave the best results with precision, recall, and f1_score of 99.5%.  This project demonstrates an accurate big data-driven and machine learning to predictive analytics approach in early cancer detection, which can improve cancer patient outcomes. Although the study utilizes only data for six cancer types, this concept of machine learning-assisted decision-making can be extended to incorporate more cancers in the future.
